# DigitalEcosystem_ChurnAnalysis
This project delves into the complex realm of customer churn within the telecommunications industry, leveraging an international dataset while focusing on its implications for Indian service providers. 
By applying advanced data analytics techniques, including exploratory analysis, churn and cohort analysis, and predictive modelling, we seek to uncover underlying patterns and hidden features driving customer attrition. The main goal is to create a reliable churn prediction algorithm that will help Indian businesses like **BSNL, Jio, and Airtel** successfully manage churn clients.


Utilizing a diverse set of predictive modelling techniques, including decision tree, random forest, and SVM, we developed a comprehensive churn prediction model. This model not only forecasts future churn occurrences but also provides actionable insights for targeted retention strategies. By harnessing the power of machine learning, our model enables Indian telecommunications companies to optimize customer retention efforts, enhance service quality, and sustain long-term growth amidst stiff competition.
